enchantR
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

enchantR is part of the [Immcantation](http://immcantation.readthedocs.io) 
analysis framework for Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing 
(AIRR-seq). Immcantation provides a set of tools to investigate lymphocyte 
receptor clonal lineages, diversity, gene usage, and other repertoire level 
properties, with a focus on high-throughput immunoglobulin (Ig) sequencing.

enchantR:

1. Provides additional quality control and reporting functions for other R
   packages in the Immcantation framework. 
2. Provides parametrized `.Rmd` reports for standard analysis.
3. Is part of the magic behind [nf-co.re/airrflow](https://nf-co.re/airrflow),
   a start-to-finish Nextflow pipeline to analyze AIRR-seq data.
